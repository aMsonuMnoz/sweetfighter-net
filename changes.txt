2.0.0
i'm considering the website in it's current state version 2.0.0. This repository will be the main home for sweetfighter.net, it will house all major and minor updates to the site.
I'll try and do change logs frequently. Relatively new to git so going to try and start fresh with this.

- deleted guestbook page, replaced with new sitemap page
- made title gif one size before and after entering, removed msg board at start for now
- modified message board, added pin
- more hover buttons
