        <h2>About us?</h2>

        <p>We are a group of 5 individuals from Beaumont, Texas attempting to exist thoroughly. Our music is made inside of our house, which we keep extremely clean. We would like to present to you our works so that you may enjoy them and book us for a live show (We are really good live). We're looking for shows around Texas to get to know more people and promote the release of our upcoming album, <i>Escape from Beautiful Mountain</i>, which is tracked entirely live in our living room and recorded on video (with cameras).</p>

        <h2>We can, and will, put on a show</h2>
        
        <p>Sweet Fighter has been performing and writing together for almost 5 years now, and we have refined our live setup over the years. We learn from every show and make constant adjustments to how we sound. We have the ability to run our own sound if need be, and we've also adapted our system to accomodate a wide range of setups. Our most recent set is up to an hour and a half jam-packed with suspenseful transitions, dramatic monologues, and minimal malfunctions. WHY BOOK US?</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>We are trained and ready</li>
            <li>We will get the job done 100% of the time</li>
            <li>Our effort and enthusiasm are unmatched</li>
            <li>We have a duty to art to fulfill</li>
            <li>Our music is clinically proven to make people buy more alcoholic beverages*</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Attached is a small sampling of live videos that we have collected over the years, including both original music and various covers.</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <p>I come into this day<br>confused and weeping.<br>A subjective being in a subjective world.<br>Out of the darkness, a light.<br>Out of the infinite, a pedestal,<br>with room for only one arbitrary truth<br>which reads thusly:<br>"Alas! Never exclaim I know not what to do,<br> for the only thing to do is to experience in as<br>much as one can, and God cannot."</p>
