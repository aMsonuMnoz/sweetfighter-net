Been trying to save myself
My legs are tired and I’ve been going down
For a while
Last night she said to me
Keep it moving don’t stop anything 
And I won’t

Been trying to save myself
My legs are tired and I’ve been going down
For a while
Last night she said to me
Keep it moving don’t stop anything 
And I won’t

The leaves need time to let ‘em grow
But you gotta let ‘em know 
That you don’t mind mind mind…

And the trees grow higher when it snows
So you gotta let ‘em know that you don’t mind mind mind…

She knows me
Creaky cares are on me
Wait too long and i’ll be
A pile of buried thoughts beneath
A cultivated love tree
A broken branch above me
The stars align the wrong way
I need to say that honestly

I wanna go back to you!

The leaves need time to let ‘em grow
But you gotta let ‘em know 
That you don’t mind, mind, mind…
And the trees grow higher when it snows
So you gotta let ‘em know that you don’t mind, mind, mind…

I wanna go back to you

I wanna go back to you

These days are keeping me alive
And sometimes I wanna close my eyes
These days are keeping me alive
And sometimes I wanna close my eyes
