        I can’t believe my eyes, my eyes
        The war is over,
        The doctor told me,
        “I’m going straight to hell”
        Oh_Well

        You came first I’ve fallen way behind 
        And I can’t wait to get you out of my mind
        When we locked eyes you came way too close
        Cheeks turned red I blushed from head to toe

        Wasted on you
        Why was it you
        It had to be you 
        Who came back to me
        Wasted on you
        Why was it you
        It had to be you 
        To come back to me
        Wasted on you
        Why was it you
        It had to be you 
        Who came back to me
        Wasted on you
        Why was it you
        It had to be you 
        To come back to me

        It’s on you I’m wasting all of my life
        And I’d give anything for one more night
        My last step was way over the line
        Piece by piece I’m losing all that’s mine

        She’s tired of his mindset
        She’s tired of his mindset
        And he’s not even back yet
        She’s waiting for the sunset
        She’s waiting for the sunset
        She’s waiting for the sensei 
        To show her where his love's at 
        To show her where his love went 
        (Waiting for the sunset)
        (Waiting for the sunset)
        (It started with the sunset)
        (It started with the sunset)
        

        Falling way behind
        (Before I go)
        Falling out of my mind
        (Won’t you Let_me_Know)
        Falling way behind
        (Before I go)
        Falling out of my mind
        (Won’t you Let_me_Know)
        Falling out of my mind

        (How was that?)
