    Days_go_away

    (But I’m still here)
    
    (But I’m still here)
    
    Days_go_away
    But I’m still here
    
    Days_go_away
    But I’m still here
    
    But would you believe 
    Last night you caught me going through it
    (Would you believe)
    
    But would you believe
    The lies I told to keep ahold 
    On what we had
    (Would you believe)
    
    Everybody wants something 
    But not everybody can win
    I’m on the bottom again
    (Days go away
    But I’m still here)
    
    Everybody wants something 
    But not everybody can win
    I’m on the bottom again
    (Days go, Days go
    But I’m still here)
    
    Everybody wants some-
    Everybody wants something 
    I’m on the bottom again
    
    Everybody wants something 
    But not everybody can win
    I’m on the bottom again
    
    (But I’m still here)
    
    Things aren’t the same 
    But I’m still near
    
    Things aren’t the same 
    But I’m still near
    
    But would you believe
    Sometimes I tend to overdo it 
    
    But could I get even with it all
    If I don’t fall
    (back back back back)
    
    Everybody wants something 
    But not everybody can win
    I’m on the bottom again
    (But could i get even)
    
    Everybody wants something 
    But not everybody can win
    I’m on the bottom again
    (Days go, Days go
    But I’m still here)
    
    Days_go_away
    But I’m still here
    
    Days_go_away
    But I’m still here
    
    Oh would you believe
    
    I’m still here
