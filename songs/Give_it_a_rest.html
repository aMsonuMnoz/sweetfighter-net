<p id="song-lyrics">
    Times it’ll be alright you could be alright
    Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright
    Be alright you could be alright
    Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright
    
    I been feeling like a scarecrow
    It never worked our I’m a natural
    It never works out when you’re an asshole
    Bad shit exists that’s alright though
    You might exist if you try to make up my mind when it’s time to
    
    Times it’ll be alright you could be alright
    Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright
    Make up my mind when it’s time to
    Be alright you could be you could fight
    Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright
    
    Give it a rest
    Be my guest
    Try to do something bout it tomorrow
    
    I know you’re under pressure sometimes it’ll be alright if you forget about it
    
    Give it a rest
    Be my guest
    Try to do something bout it tomorrow
    
    I know you’re under pressure sometimes it’ll be alright if you forget about it
    Yeah I’ve been feeling like a scarecrow no hope no pain
    Y’all are really worried bout the wrong things
    All day too late
    Not really upset if I miss the train
    Not really upset if I miss today
    
    Not really upset at all I can’t stay for long
    Got no problems with these people but they think they said it all
    Think they said it all Think they said it all
    Prayers work fine till I leave and people fall
    
    (Times it’ll be alright you could be alright)
    Don’t you wanna waste some time
    (Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright)
    (Be alright you could be alright)
    (Pressure sometimes It’ll be alright)
     When I feel it going that way
    (Forget about about it) (Forget about about it)
    It takes me further on
    
    (Forget about about it)
    Give it a rest (Forget about about it)
    Be my guest
    (Forget about about it)
    Try to do something bout it tomorrow
    (I know you’re under pressure sometimes it’ll be alright if you forget about it)
    
    Give it a rest
    Be my guest
    Try to do something bout it tomorrow
    (Gotta start somewhere)
    
    When I feel it going !!!!
    
    Pressure sometimes Pressure sometimes
