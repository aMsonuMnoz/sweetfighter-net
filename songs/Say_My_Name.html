I’ve been getting rid of the dividends
And the misconception that it’s all done in the end
But it’s not relative
And i’m not giving in
(I’m not giving in)
No, I’m not giving in

But would you ever Say_my_name again?
‘Cause I don’t want to fade away again…
But would you ever Say_my_name, Say_my_name again?

I’d wait a couple days
If i had the chance 
I’d go straight to hell but it all turns out alright (alright)

I’ve been getting rid of the dividends (getting rid)

Just stick to the motions
Don’t always be open
Everybody’s hoping
That you just fall apart, fall apart… fall apart

I’d wait a couple days
If i had the chance 
I’d go straight to hell but it all turns out alright

Wait wait wait a couple days
If i had the chance
But it all turns (all turns right)

Wait wait wait a couple days
If i had the chance
But it all turns (all turns right)

Say_my_name again
‘Cause i don’t want to fade away again (all turns, all turns)
Say_my_name, Say_my_name again

If I could be free
If I could be free
If I could be free
If I could be free

If I could be free from all my pain and all the things and all the rain I wouldn’t leave

If I could be free
If I could be free

If I could be free from all my pain and all the things and all the rain I wouldn’t leave

If I could be free
If I could be free

If I could be FREE

FREE FREE FREE FREE FREE
