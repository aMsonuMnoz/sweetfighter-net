    Worship like a fool
    Even in the Sunshine
    Waiting_for_the_calf_to_die
    So I could leave my aunt’s house
    
    (Even in the-)
    (Waiting for the-)
    
    Take a picture
    Put it into frame
    Before it all goes away and i’m left
    I’m left without a trace of us
    
    Stumbling ahead
    ‘Cause it’s the only way I can
    
    
    Tell me what you’re waiting for
    Burn my memories away
    Tell me what you’re waiting for
    Burn my memories away
    
    Wake up, bad luck, so what?
    Even as the sun’s down, don’t drown on me
    Waiting for the time to try to stay alive
    Try not to cry but pray for mine
    And I hope you know what to call that
    I hope I know how to solve that
    
    I think there’s something cruel
    Hidden in my roots (don’t drown, don’t drown)
    It’s coming for to take me away
    The hell it will
    
    And I hope you know what to call that
    I hope I know how to solve that
    
    Stumbling ahead
    ‘Cause it’s the only way I can
    
    Tell me what you’re waiting for
    Burn my memories away
    If happy’s what you’re waiting for
    Burn my memories away
    
    Worship like a fool
    Even in the Sunshine
    Waiting_for_the_calf_to_die
    So I could leave my aunt’s house
    Take a picture
    Put it into frame
    Before it all goes away and i’m left
    I’m left without a trace of us
