<p id="song-lyrics">
    You don’t gotta be taking off to put it on
    Your bad habits match my wrongs
    And could it be in my dreams?
    TELL ME!
    
    (Alright, enough fucking around)
    
    SpeakingSpeakingSpeakingSpeaking of your regrets
    Tried to give reasons to forget and now we’re worked up and upset
    Promised not to leave but you already believe it
    Yeah
    
    Before I go, won’t you Let_me_Know (Know)
    Before I go, won’t you Let_me_Know  *Cymbal crash* (Know)
    
    Freedom’s only free when you don’t want it
    But that’s not all I need
    There’s way more to it
    Like all of the things I keep forgetting about myself
    
    (Have you been alright? How has your family been? What you been up to?)
    You don’t wanna fight yeah I guess that’s alright
    But I’m still fighting
    (Feels like it’s been years)
    Do you still think of me?
    (Can you remember?) Everything we had don’t lose your footing now don’t lose hope baby
    
    Before I go, won’t you Let_me_Know (Know)
    Before I go, won’t you Let_me_Know  *Cymbal crash* (Know)
    
    And if it’s my fate put me in my place
    And I am not afraid to feel nothing inside one day
    
    (Don’t you wonder what it feels like?)
    Won’t you let me know?
    (Don’t you wonder what it feels like?)
    Ooooo won’t you let me know?
    
    *Sick shit*
