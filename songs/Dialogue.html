    Movies from the 80's
    They never make sense
    They never make sense
    How'd they get their houses
    And both of their parents
    And what is a basement
    They never make sense
    What is a basement
    Who writes dialogue
    Thrown off by what I said
    They never make sense
    What is a basement
    Who writes dialogue
    Thrown off by what I said
    Fake an accident to loosen up
    Make pretend while they're still rolling
    Sound intelligent while giving up
    Forgot my lines and they noticed
    And we watched eight and a half or the good life
    But you weren't in love
    And I'll be an actor
    And you'll write it all out
    And then some
    Is it my fault
    I'm too involved again
    Put some clothes on
    Get it all wrong and then
    I'll cry about the length of my jeans
    It's fine I just want to be pretty
    Write me in your story
    Give me a name that sounds like mine
    I won't get the meaning
    But I'll compliment your
    Dialogue
    I saw that one last year
    I'll see it again
    It makes me think of looking out
    All the way
    I like the way they talk
    How every sentence
    Doesn't mean a thing
