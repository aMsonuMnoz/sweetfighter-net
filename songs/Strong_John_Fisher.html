<p id="song-lyrics">
    Capture my heart forget all the words color my stare and leave me alone cut off my hair you always were the one who knew how long’s enough (1,2..) (I need a recap of everything we just did)

    End of my rope, a nightless sleep pleasure to be a knife-less thief i’ll put it right back i’ll put it right back (put it right back i’ll put it right back) ohhh give it right back give it right back
    
    From one hospital to the closest over doctor I’m all good I spent a year looking up
    
    If all we’ll ever know is what we’re looking at and all there ever was is what we’re looking at If all we’ll ever have is what we’re looking at and all there really is is what we’re looking at
    
    From one hospital to the closest over doctor I’m all good I spent a year looking up
    
    and I save myself from the fire
    and I save myself from the fire
