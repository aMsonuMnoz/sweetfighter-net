    [Could I really ask for more]
[Could I really ask for more]

His head’s really holding a weight
And it’s really showing today
Go ahead and have a word
With your father
While we’re all still here
In the Garden

(in the)
(in the)
(we’ll be ooooh)
(in the)
[Garden, Garden]

In the city
In the dawn
We’ll be sitting
All day long

Could you really ask for more
Remember thinking i’m impressed
Could I really ask for more
Feel something good to talk about

(Could you really ask for more)
Climbed to the top of the cabin
(Remember thinking)
Remember thinking I was impressed
(Could you really ask for more)
Could I really ask for more
Now how’s the city treating you now that it’s gone?

Treat me like an image of home
‘Cause I look like someone I don’t know

In the city
In the dawn
We’ll be sitting
All day long

In the city
In the dawn
We’ll be sitting
All day long

Pray for me when you mess up
Apologies are hard enough
I look this way when days get rough
I’m talking but nobody asked

Nobody asked somebody else
Nobody has turned against you
Nobody asked for somebody else
Nobody has turned against you

Nobody asked for somebody else
Nobody has turned against you

(turned against you)
(turned against you)
