    Us
    Who needs it more?
    Weather those absent days
    After us
    I didn’t need no more
    (Need no more)
    Than sunlight across your face
    
    And we’ll find our ways of falling down
    (Find our ways of falling down)
    And we’ll find our ways of falling down
    (Find our ways of falling down)
    
    (Moved right past us) (and I’ll call back)
    
    Stray slow
    Still got your name sewn
    To all my ways home
    
    Stay, go
    Wear down the days don’t
    We know the gray’s close
    
    You were calling
    I guess I missed it
    But I think I heard a telephone ring
    And it was autumn
    And we missed it
    Oh what I’d give for a sight of those leaves
    (Our ways are falling) (For a sight of those leaves)
    (You were calling, ahhh) (What I’d given)
    
    When I’m fine is sounding like a lie you can’t quite pull off
    (Our ways are falling)
    Say “I’m fine,” and go for a ride and stay in the lines
    (Our ways are falling)
    
    —Guitar Riff—
    
    And I’ll call back and you won’t say much and I’ll be forward
    And I’ll hang from every letter ‘cause we don’t talk enough
    
    Oh, It moved right past us (It moved right past us) before it took it’s shape
    (YOU WERE CALLING, YOU WERE CALLING, AND I CALLED BACK)
    Oh, steer it steady ‘cause I’m still taking aim
    
    (Sight of those leaves) (Our ways are falling down) (You were calling, ahh) (What I’d given)
    
    And we’ll find (find) our ways are falling (falling) down (find our ways are falling down)
    And we’ll find (find) our ways are falling (falling) down (find our ways are falling down)
    
    And we’ll try to make each other laugh and maybe fall in love and we’ll laugh and make each other mad and you’ll say that’s enough
