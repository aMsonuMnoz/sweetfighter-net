    Don’t bring me back down to earth
    Cause I’m here, I’m here
    
    I’m sleeping outside for her
    Don’t let me in, let me in
    
    I’m waking up with the sun
    Cause you’re here, you’re here 
    
    My heads loaded like a gun
    Don’t let me think, let me think
    
    These nights
    They’re always keeping me in
    
    Those eyes
    I wanna see them again
    
    In moonlight
    My bodys changing again
    
    The sun died
    and now the hunt begins
    
    And I’ve been waiting 
    For you, the sky is blue enough
    
    And I’ve been chasing
    All kinds of butterflies 
    
    And now I’m thinking
    My heart knows what it wants from me
    
    Cause I’ve been craving 
    Those emerald eyes
    
    
    In moonlight
    My bodys changing again
    
    The sun died
    And now the hunt begin
    
    In moonlight
    My bodys changing again
    
    The sun died
    Now let the hunt begin
