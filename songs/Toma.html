    Boom Boom Boom Toma!
    Days pass, my shoes on
    Feeling good
    Feeling good
    And i don't wanna waste my time
    (feeling good)
    Feeling blue
    I'd rather feel green (feeling good)
    I'd rather feel you (ooh!)
    With me (feeling good, feeling good)


    Cruise control on
    (Take time to make it right)
    I'm just driving down
    (Shoes on it'll be alright)
    The street
    (I'm here, you're here)

    These traps that you're placing
    They're working well
    Oh I don't know 
    How to tell what i'd rather doooo
    But if i had to chooooose
    I'd rather feel blue
    I'd rather feel green
    Than be without you (do dodo doo)
    And meeeeee

    Cruise control on
    (Take time to make it right)
    I'm just driving down
    (Shoes on it'll be alright)
    The street
    (I'm here, you're here)

    Cruise control on
    (Take time to make it right)
    I'm just driving down
    (Shoes on it'll be alright)
    The street
    (I'm here, you're here)

    And here we are now (here we are)
    Once again (once again)
    All alone (all alone)
    It's now or never, (it is now)
    And i've been spending too much time on my own (on my own)
    After you baby (after you) 
    No one else (no one else)
    Could drive it home (drives it home)

    Feeling good...

    Ohhhh...
    Ohhhh...
    Just driving...

    Ohhhh...
    Ohhhh...
    Ohhhh!
    Ohhhh!
    Ohhhh!
    Ohhhh!

    And i don't wanna waste my time feeling blue

    Ohhhh?
    Ohhhh?
    Ohhhh?
    Ohhhh?
