<p id="song-lyrics">
In through one ear out the other end
In through one ear out the other and I'll be walking my dog richie; plans, make plans.
Interested in crimes that have nothing to do with you, someone stole my ride that don't bother me a single bit.
Steal off your ghost, am I still just asking too much
Twist my wrist i'm fine i'll just clasp my hands and wait and plan for a while,
wait and plan for a while. 
Could you steal off your ghost?
Am i still just asking too much?
Now there's zeros in my code.
Is it still a bad thing to rush?
Steal off your ghost, am i still just asking too much?
Zeros in my code, is it still a bad thing to rush?
rush?
rush?
rush?
