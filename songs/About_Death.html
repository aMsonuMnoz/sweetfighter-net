Come back to me I’m lost in
A place where angels got in
Danger; Danger
Wait around for me

My lazy eye sees stars now
My breathing’s slowing way down 
Save me; Save me 
Lay me down to sleep

(ooo, ooo, ooo)

Spirit in my hands
Lungs filled up with sand
Not enough breath to dance
With you; With you 

She said, “I don’t need you now”
“And I know you’re wrong about death (death!)”
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh she meant what she meant to me
Oh baby let’s grow the love tree 
(I know you’re wrong about death)

She said, “I don’t need you now”
“And I know you’re wrong about death (death!)”
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh she meant what she meant to me
Oh baby let’s grow the love tree 
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh i don’t know just where i’m going yet
But it’s away from me
I’m drifting out to sea

And home seems so far now it’s killing me
Cause she’s over me
Golden memories

Spirit in my hands
Lungs filled up with sand
Not enough breath to dance
With you; With you
 
Spirit in my hands
Lungs filled up with hands
Not enough breath to dance
With you; With you 

Come back to me I’m lost in
A place where angels got in
Danger; Danger
Wait around for me

My lazy eye sees stars now
My breathings slowing way down 
Save me; Save me 
Lay me down to sleep

She said, “I don’t need you now”
“And I know you’re wrong about death (death!)”
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh she meant what she meant to me
Oh baby let’s grow the love tree 
(I know you’re wrong about death)

(Death) (Death)
(I know you’re wrong about death)

She said, “I don’t need you now”
“And I know you’re wrong about death (death!)”
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh she meant what she meant to me 
Oh baby let’s grow the love tree 
(I know you’re wrong about death)

She said, “I don’t need you now”
“And I know you’re wrong about death (death!)”
(I know you’re wrong about death)

Oh she meant what she meant
