(SLEEP
TAKE
FIGHT
SLEEP
PRAY
LET ME SLEEP)
Even while you sleep

I
(Yeah, but, you asked for this, you asked for this)
Need more
I 
Could’ve been asleep
(You’re squeezing me so hard)
Need more
(My people love)

Someday,
I hope to get through
Or used to this

Someday 
Someday

Need more

(Could’ve been asleep)

Let’s try divorce
(Need more)
I’m tired of course
Wide awake for
Nothing else
Nothing helps

(Could’ve been asleep)
I could’ve been asleep 
(Need more)
By now
Nothing else 
Nothing helps 

Wait
For a while
Not getting through 

(Could’ve been asleep)
I could’ve been asleep
But now

1-800-WatchuWant
Need a call tomorrow to ensure I get up
Need more money to show all my people love
Need more money to show all my people love
Love

1-800-WatchuWant
Need a call tomorrow to ensure I get up
Need more money to show all my people love
Need more money to show all my people love
Love

1-800-WatchuWant
Need a call tomorrow to ensure I get up
Need more money to show all my people love
Need more money to show all my people love
Love
