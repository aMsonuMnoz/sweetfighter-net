    Blood oranges so sweet
    The vessel to your heart is through the teeth
    
    Go sailing in my dreams
    And I don't wanna stop until the beach
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    I love the way she disappears  
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    I love the way she disappears  
    
    Oooh
    Thought I had it all when you were near
    I looked away, you disappeared 
    
    Oooh
    Never had a chance when you were near
    I looked away, you disappeared 
    
    Roses
    They never looked so good until I noticed 
    The thorns in the bottom part 
    
    Roses
    (Roses)
    They never looked so good until I noticed 
    (Noticed)
    The thorns in the bottom part 
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    (The vessel took your)
    I love the way she disappears  
    (Go sailing)
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    (And I don’t wanna)
    I love the way she disappears  
    (Roses)
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    (The vessel to your)
    I love the way she disappears  
    (Go sailing)
    
    I love the way, love the way I had it all
    (And I don’t wanna)
    I love the way she disappears  
    
    (Rest in peace 
    You know what to do 
    Westheimer Street 
    Rest in peace
    I’ll see you after life
    My father please)
